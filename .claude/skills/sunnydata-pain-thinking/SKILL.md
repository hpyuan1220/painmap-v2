description: Use when exploring or validating whether a pain point is real (not whether it can make money). Stage 1 only — runs the 9-step pain discovery flow with SECI lenses and first-principles/Socratic engines. Output is a user-authored written verdict (true/fake/pending-interview) with a 100-word reason and a next action — no numeric scoring, no mode toggle. Money, payment, manual delivery, and BCG DRI belong to Stage 2 (sprint manual) and are NOT triggered by this skill.

# Pain Thinking — 階段一痛點發想（v2.1 蘇格拉底大一統）

> **Authoritative source:** `docs/design/painmap_pain_thinking_system.md`
> **Companion lecture:** `docs/workshop/painpoint_systematic_thinking_lecture.md`
> **Beginner worksheet:** `docs/workshop/painpoint_beginner_worksheet.md`
> **Engine docs:** `docs/product/first_principles_playbook.md`, `docs/product/socratic_first_principles_rnd_workflow.md`
> **Stage 2 hand-off:** `docs/product/first_principles_sprint_manual.md` (commercial validation, NOT loaded by this skill)

## v2.1 變更摘要（2026-05-02）

v2 引入「兩階段」骨架（痛點發想 vs 商業驗證）解決最嚴重的混淆。v2.1 進一步把階段一本身**蘇格拉底大一統**：

- **刪除** 0–25 Pain Quality Score（5 維度 × 1–5 分）— 寫作本身就是反思，不需要分數鏡子。
- **刪除** Teaching mode / Production mode 雙模式切換 — 沒有分數要藏，自然不需要兩種模式。
- **刪除** TRIZ 六矛盾分類學 — 卡 5 改成「使用者用自己的話寫 trade-off」。
- **保留** 9 步骨架、anti-IdeaCheck 立場、S1/S2 詰問、物理量 #1 / #2、verdict 書面交付。

判斷力由「動筆寫」而非「打分數」訓練；UI 與 prompt 只用反思提示，從不評等。

## When to use

Load this skill whenever:
- A user describes a complaint, gripe, or "wouldn't it be cool if…" idea
- A PM/founder asks whether a pain point is **real**, not whether it's **profitable**
- You're about to brainstorm features before validating the underlying pain
- You hear claims like "the market needs X" without named people behind it

**Do NOT skip when:**
- The complaint sounds obviously true (obvious complaints have hidden assumptions)
- The user already has a "score" from another tool (scores are anxiety products, not decision inputs — see `first_principles_playbook.md §7 反模式 A`)

**This skill does NOT cover:**
- Manual delivery design (Stage 2 — see sprint manual)
- Payment rail setup (Stage 2)
- Pre-sales / first-dollar capture (Stage 2)
- BCG DRI attack-layer decision (Stage 2 — applies AFTER pain is validated)

## The Iron Laws

```
1. Pain validation is INDEPENDENT from commercial validation.
2. Stage 1 outputs a WRITTEN TRUE/FAKE/PENDING verdict — NOT a payment, NOT a score.
3. NO step skipping. A step's exit reflection unanswered → cannot advance.
4. NO money talk in Stage 1. If money comes up, it belongs in Stage 2.
5. NO numeric scoring at any point. If a number appears, you've imported the wrong tool.
```

## Architecture: Two Stages × Lenses × Engines

```
Stage 1 (this skill): PAIN DISCOVERY — no money, no score
  ▸ 9 steps aligned with Sunny's workshop structure
  ▸ Lenses: SECI Externalize → trade-off articulation → SECI Combination → SECI Socialization
  ▸ Engines: First Principles (#1, #2 only) + Socratic (S1/S2)
  ▸ Endpoint: written true/fake/pending verdict + 100-word reason + named next action

Stage 2 (NOT in this skill): COMMERCIAL VALIDATION — money
  ▸ Physical quantities #3 (manual deliverable) + #4 (payment rail)
  ▸ BCG DRI attack layer
  ▸ 72-hour sprint → first real payment
  ▸ See: docs/product/first_principles_sprint_manual.md
```

## Physical Quantities (this skill uses #1, #2 only)

| # | Quantity | Check | Step | Stage |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Specific people | Can you call 3 named individuals right now? | Step 2 | 1 ✓ |
| 2 | Pain w/ time/cost investment | Does the workaround have a name? | Step 2 | 1 ✓ |
| 3 | Manual deliverable | Can you do it tonight without code? | — | 2 (NOT here) |
| 4 | Payment rail | Do you have a shareable payment link now? | — | 2 (NOT here) |

**v2 wording fix:** #2 is "pain w/ time/cost investment" not "paying pain" — avoids implying you need a paying customer at the discovery stage.

## Socratic Templates

**S1 (Step 2):** Three elements required — Who / When / How observed.

**S2 (Step 9):** Three locked questions:
1. **Falsifiability:** What evidence would make me drop this pain?
2. **Alternative cause:** Is this actually a different pain in disguise?
3. **Definition drift:** Is the Step 1 pain owner still the Step 8 interview target?

## The Nine Steps — Run This as TodoWrite

When you load this skill, immediately create these 9 todos:

```
[ ] Step 1. 聆聽            — verbatim complaint + 1 specific scene
[ ] Step 2. 5 要素 + S1     — pain sentence + 5 elements + 3-person list + workaround name (#1, #2)
[ ] Step 3. 寫卡關公式       — articulate the stuck-formula sentence in user's own words
[ ] Step 4. 找 trade-off     — surface the user's irreducible trade-off + which side gets sacrificed and why
[ ] Step 5. 選 AI 工具       — choose ChatGPT DR / Claude / Perplexity / Gemini
[ ] Step 6. AI 找證據        — run the 8-question evidence prompt (NO product/biz model)
[ ] Step 7. 自己先猜+讀 AI  — write 3 guesses BEFORE reading AI; then compare deltas
[ ] Step 8. 規劃真人訪談     — pick 2 interview targets + 3 questions + interview taboos
[ ] Step 9. 真/假判斷 + S2  — written verdict + 3 S2 answers + 100-word reason + next action
```

Mark each todo `in_progress` on entry, `completed` only when the user has produced the written reflection for that step.

> **Card 5 surfaces the user's irreducible trade-off in their own words; no taxonomic labels.** If the user reaches for "TRIZ contradiction #2" or any other framework label, redirect them to write what each side wants and which side is being given up — in their own sentences.

### Step reflection gates (the prompts, not pass/fail)

| Step | Reflection that must be written before advancing |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Verbatim transcript with at least one specific named person + one concrete scene |
| 2 | All 5 elements concrete (no "should" / "probably") + 3-person list + workaround has a name |
| 3 | Stuck-formula sentence a stranger could repeat to a third person |
| 4 | Side A wants ___, side B wants ___, sacrificed side + one-sentence reason why that side gets dropped |
| 5 | AI tool chosen with 1-sentence reason |
| 6 | AI returned 8 answers + did NOT enter solution mode |
| 7 | 3 written guesses + 4 readability checkpoints reviewed + 3 deltas identified |
| 8 | At least 1 interview target with concrete contact + 3 non-pitch questions |
| 9 | Written verdict (true/fake/pending-interview) + 3 S2 answers + 100-word reason + named next action |

**When a reflection is missing or shallow, do NOT mark "fail" — instead surface the unanswered question and invite the user to think again.** No red, no checkmark grid, no "exit gate" framing.

**Failure routing (as suggestions, never blocks):**
- Step 2 thin → suggest returning to Step 1 (the user has not actually met real people yet)
- Step 4 thin → suggest revisiting Step 2 (5 elements are still too abstract to surface a real trade-off)
- Step 6 returns solutions → suggest re-prompting AI with stronger "no solutions" rule
- Step 7 deltas missing → suggest giving the AI more context from steps 1–4
- Step 8 has no contact → suggest returning to Step 2 (the community is not within reach yet)
- Step 9 S2 reveals definition drift → suggest going back to the drift point and rebuilding

## Step 6 Standard Prompt (copy-paste)

```
我想研究一個可能的痛點：
[Step 2 痛點句]

痛點主人翁特徵：[Step 2 具體人群]
他現在用：[Step 2 workaround]
不滿之處：[Step 2 現有解法不滿]
卡關公式：[Step 3 stuck-formula 句]
他的 trade-off：[Step 4 side_a / side_b / 被犧牲的那邊 + 為什麼]

⚠️ 重要規則：
- 請不要幫我設計產品，也不要提出商業模式
- 請不要建議 App、SaaS、解決方案
- 請只做痛點探索與證據蒐集

請回答 8 題：
1. 哪些具體人群最常遇到？請列 3–5 群
2. 通常在什麼場景發生？頻率多高？
3. 他們現在怎麼解決？請列 5 個 workaround
4. 現有解法有哪些不滿？分成時間/品質/情緒/資料整理
5. 公開證據？論壇/社群/產業文章/工具評論/搜尋趨勢
6. 背後 JTBD 是什麼？
7. 哪些可能是假痛點？
8. 應該訪談哪 5 種人？每種人 3 題訪談問題

不確定的標 [推測]。不要對任何結論加裝飾性評論。不要打分數。
```

> Old prompts asked AI to score 5 dimensions on 1–5 — that line is removed. The AI is here to surface evidence, not to grade you.

## Step 7 Self-Guess Discipline

**BEFORE** reading the AI response, write down:
- Who do you guess is most pained?
- Which scenario do you guess is most painful?
- One possible fake pain you guess might exist?

**THEN** read the AI response with these 4 checkpoints (these are reflection prompts, not a rubric):
1. Did it segment people specifically? (no "office workers")
2. Did it find observable scenarios? (time + place + action)
3. Did it list workaround dissatisfactions? (≥3 with reasons)
4. Did it flag possible fake pains? (≥1)

**THEN** identify 3 deltas: AI added what / AI missed what / your guess wrong where.

**Why guess first:** Reading AI directly creates "yes it's right!" illusion (AI just paraphrases your question). Pre-guess is the only way to train judgment.

## Output: Written Verdict (single format)

Stage 1 ends with one artifact — a user-authored verdict card:

```
痛點：[Step 2 句子]
判斷：[真痛點 | 假痛點 | 待訪談]
書面理由（≥ 100 字，使用者親筆，不可由 AI 生成）：
[100-word reason connecting Steps 1–8 evidence to the verdict]

最有把握的證據：[使用者親筆]
最沒把握的地方：[使用者親筆]

S2 壓力測試：
1. 可證偽性：什麼證據會讓我放棄？
2. 假因排除：是不是其實是另一個痛點？
3. 定義漂移：Step 1 主人翁 vs Step 8 訪談對象同一人/情境嗎？

下一步：[排訪談 / 補證據 / 換題目 / 進階段二 sprint]
完成日期：[YYYY-MM-DD]
```

**No numeric scoring at any layer.** The verdict's authority comes from the user's own writing connecting evidence to judgment, not from a number. If a downstream system needs a status string, use the lifecycle label (`draft` after Step 1, `structured` after Step 9 with a true verdict) — but never produce a 0–25 score.

## Anti-patterns (Red flags — STOP if you see these)

| Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stage-skip** | "Let me design the manual delivery now" before Step 9 verdict | Stage 1 must complete with written verdict before Stage 2 begins |
| **Money in Stage 1** | "What's my pricing?" / "Where do I put the payment link?" | Block — that's Stage 2. Continue with current step. |
| **Step-skip** | "This needs Reshape" before Step 6/7 evidence | DRI is Stage 2. Force written reflection at every Stage 1 step |
| **Score creep** | Anyone produces a 0–25 number, a 5-dimension grade, or a "pain quality score" | Stop. Delete the number. Replace with the Socratic question that exposed the gap. |
| **Taxonomy fixation** | Forcing the trade-off into a TRIZ contradiction or any other label | Step 4 is user-authored prose only. If a label appears, ask the user to write what each side wants instead. |
| **AI-flattery** | Asking AI "is this a real pain?" | Step 9 verdict must be human-written; AI may red-team but not generate the verdict |
| **Synthetic persona** | Skipping real interviews via AI personas | Step 1 hard reflection: real named person; Step 8 must come from Step 2 list |
| **Solution-jump in Step 6** | AI prompt response includes "you should build…" | Re-prompt with stronger "no solutions" rule |
| **Pass/fail framing** | UI says "exit gate failed" / "你沒過關" | Replace with "still worth thinking about ___ before moving on" — neutral reflection prompt |

## Quick reference card (paste at top of session)

```
ENGINES (every step):
  S1: who/when/how-observed
  S2: falsifiability / alt-cause / drift
  PQ: #1 specific people / #2 time-or-cost-invested pain (Stage 1 only — #3, #4 in Stage 2)

LENSES (in order):
  Step 1+2 SECI Socialization+Externalization (verbatim → 5 elements)
  Step 3 stuck-formula sentence in user's own words
  Step 4 trade-off articulation in user's own words (NO taxonomy labels)
  Step 6 SECI Combination (AI evidence)
  Step 7 Socratic self-articulation BEFORE reading AI
  Step 8 SECI Socialization confirmation (real interviews)

EXIT: Stage 1 ends with WRITTEN VERDICT (real/fake/pending), 100-word reason, named next action.
NEVER: numeric score, mode toggle, taxonomy label, pass/fail UI.
NEXT: True verdict → Stage 2 sprint manual (NOT this skill).
```

## When to defer to other skills

- **Pain confirmed true, ready for commercial validation** → load `first_principles_sprint_manual.md` (Stage 2)
- **Need to design disruptive GTM** → see `painmap_disruption_framework.md` (post-Stage 2)
- **Need to design moat strategy** → see `painmap_moat_design.md`
- **Pain confirmed, ready to code product** → only after Stage 2 verifies payment; load `superpowers:test-driven-development`

## Verification

After running this skill end-to-end on a pain, verify:
- [ ] All 9 todos completed in order (no jumps)
- [ ] Each step has written user output
- [ ] Physical quantities #1, #2 each checked (NOT #3, #4 — those are Stage 2)
- [ ] Step 4 trade-off is in the user's own prose (no TRIZ labels, no "contradiction type")
- [ ] Step 9 has written true/fake/pending verdict + 100-word reason + named next action
- [ ] No numeric score (0–25, 1–5 dimensions, "pain quality") appears anywhere
- [ ] No "let's build it" / "set up payment" suggested in Stage 1
- [ ] No pass/fail / exit-gate framing in any UI or prompt copy

If any item fails, the diagnosis is incomplete — do not claim the pain is validated.

## Why no scores, no modes, no taxonomy (v2.1 design rationale)

v1 mixed pain discovery with commercial validation. v2 split them. v2.1 went further inside Stage 1:

- **Score removed** because writing a 100-word reason already forces every dimension a 5-point grid was approximating — and the number invited "24/25, ship it" misuse no disclaimer ever fixed.
- **Mode toggle removed** because the only thing the toggle protected was the score; once the score is gone, "teaching mode" and "production mode" describe the same artifact.
- **Taxonomy removed from card 5** because borrowing TRIZ's six contradictions added authority without adding clarity. Asking the user "what does each side want, and which side gets dropped" surfaces the same trade-off in language the interview target can recognize.

The skill now trains judgment by making the user write — observation → decomposition → evidence → judgment — with Socratic questions, not graded outputs. That is the entire point of Stage 1.
